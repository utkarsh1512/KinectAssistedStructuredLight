# KinectAssistedStructuredLight
High Resolution Structured Light Scanning with low calibration effort. This is the MATLAB fro my M.Tech. project. The main aim was to redduce the checkerboard based calibration of the structured light 3D scanning setup as it is cumbersome and time consuming every time the setup is moved. This purpose was achieved using an additional off the shelf 3D scanner (Kinect here). The coarse depth map from the Kinect was used to calibrate the structured light 3D scanning setuo consisting of a projector and ahigh resolution 3D camera.

# Motivation
The project is kept here for maintainance and updates as the results achieved were really good but on the fron of accuracy, it needs some work. Also, as of now, there are many hard coded values that I will try to move to a single script or a yml file where the user can change it easily.
